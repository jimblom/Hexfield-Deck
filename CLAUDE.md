# Hexfield Deck

## Project Overview

Hexfield Deck is a markdown-powered task board for VS Code and Obsidian. Parse your markdown files into an interactive kanban board — drag cards across columns, set due dates, apply tags, and manage your workflow without ever leaving your editor. Your notes, your board, your deck.

## Naming & Theme

The name "Hexfield Deck" is an MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) reference:

- **Hexfield** — The Hexfield Viewscreen on the Satellite of Love, the ship's visual display/communication screen.
- **Deck** — Triple meaning: the command deck of the SOL (where the viewscreen lives), a deck of cards (kanban boards use cards), and the general "flight deck" connotation of command and oversight.

The broader product line may follow an MST3K theme — either SOL components or movie titles from episodes. Some names held in reserve for future tools:

| Concept | Candidate Name | MST3K Reference |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Time tracking | Time Chasers | Ep #821 |
| Secrets/config | Code Name: Diamond Head | Ep #608 |
| Diff/change tool | Quest of the Delta Knights | Ep #913 |
| Task runner | Hobgoblins | Ep #907 |
| Profiler | Overdrawn at the Memory Bank | Ep #822 |
| Snapshots | Jack Frost | Ep #813 |

## Origin

This is a clean-room reimagining of a VS Code extension the author built internally at work ("MD Taskboard") to replace a OneNote-based workflow. This public version is a hard fork of the concept, designed from scratch for broader use and dual-platform support (VS Code + Obsidian).

## Technical Decisions
