# Hexfield Deck

> **Markdown-powered kanban task board for VS Code and Obsidian**

Hexfield Deck transforms your markdown weekly planner files into interactive kanban boards. Write tasks in plain text with inline metadata, then visualize and manage them on a drag-and-drop board — all without ever leaving your editor.

## 🎬 About the Name

**Hexfield Deck** is named after the **Hexfield Viewscreen** on the Satellite of Love from _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ — the ship's main visual display and communication screen. The name is a triple reference:

- **Hexfield** — The iconic hexagonal viewscreen
- **Deck** — The command deck where the viewscreen lives, a deck of cards (kanban), and the connotation of command/oversight
